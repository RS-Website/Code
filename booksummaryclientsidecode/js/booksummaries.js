The five regions corresponding to thse five Shabds have not been revealed. The mention of Sahas-dal-kanwal, Trikuti, Sunn, and Bhanwargupha is nowhere to be found, though the name ‘Sach Khand’ has appeared at many places. That which Nank Saheb had kept  hidden was not disclosed by Soamiji Maharaj also. At oneplace, however, has Soamiji Maharaj hinted about it. On the basis of this hint Sant Das ji explained tat  the five Shabds of Dharam Khand, Gyan Khand, Saram Khand, karam Khand and Sach Khand, referred to by Nanak Saheb in japji are in fact none other than Sahas-daal-kanwal, Trikuti, Sunn,, Bhanwargupha and Sat lok respectively. <br/> Similarly, the three modes of spiritual practices, viz., Sumiran, Dhyan and Bhajan, are not mentioned in Japji in exactly these words. There, however, is a command in the book  at many places  to sing the praise of the Supreme Being, to engender love for His holy feet and to listen to the Lord’s Bani and behest. As a matter of fact these three modes refer to Sumiran, Dhyan and Bhajan. <br />In this book, Japji has been presented simultanieously in three languages, viz.
